                <li class="desc">It has a core where nuclear fusion occurs, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.</li>
                <li class="desc">The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, exhibits sunspots and solar flares.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li class="desc">The Sun rotates on its axis, but different parts rotate at different rates due to its gaseous nature.</li>
                <li class="desc">A complete rotation takes around 25 days at the equator and up to 35 days at the poles.</li>
            </ul>
