            <p class="title">Uranus</p>
            <p class="descTitle">Structure and Surface</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="desc">Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.</li>
                <li class="desc">Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing icy materials above a solid core.</li>
                <li class="desc">Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.</li>
                <li class="desc">Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side.</li>
                <li class="desc">Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="descTitle">Time on Uranus</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="desc">One day on Uranus lasts a little over 17 hours (17 hours and 14 minutes, to be exact).</li>
                <li class="desc">One year on Uranus is the same as 84 years on Earth. That’s a long time to wait for a birthday cake.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="descTitle">Uranus' Neighbors</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="desc">Uranus has 27 known moons.</li>
                <li class="desc">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. That means Saturn and Neptune are Uranus’ neighboring planets.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="descTitle">Quick History</p>
            <ul>

                <li class="desc">Uranus has only been visited by Voyager 2.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="imgDesc">This picture shows Uranus surrounded by its four major rings and by 10 of its moons. This image has colors added to show the different altitudes and thicknesses of clouds in the atmosphere. Green and blue areas show where the atmosphere is clear and sunlight can get through. The yellow and grey parts have thicker clouds. Orange and red colors mean very high clouds, similar to cirrus clouds on Earth.</p>

            <p class="imgDesc">The Hubble Space Telescope took this picture of Uranus. You can see bands and a dark spot in Uranus' atmosphere.</p>
